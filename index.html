      <h1>What is Study Buddies?</h1>
      <p>
        Study Buddies is a study group

        Our project idea is a study group/partner finder dedicated for UMass students. Users may publicly
        display their profiles
        under sections designated to certain classes or majors. Users can set tags on their profile designating what classes
        they're currently taking, classes they've taken before, potentially subjects they frequently work in/majors and
        minors,
        etc. Additionally users may be able to input their course numbers and in return get an auto generated schedule for
        their
        classes in google calendar that also takes into account UMass specific special days and holidays. Users can choose to
        publicly display this calendar on their profile for others to compare their own schedules to in order to find
        availabilities for their potential partners/groupmates. Additionally users may be able to link an invite to their
        group
        or profile to external websites or applications.
