# Innovative Idea

  Our idea is a UMASS study group finder and scheduler. It will match students with overlapping classes and free periods together so they can meet regularly to study or work on homework. It will use Google calendar to schedule meetings.

# Important Components

## Google Calendar Schedule Export

  In order to incentivize users to use the service initially, we provide a convenient way to export class schedules to a Google calendar. Users start by inputting class section numbers from SPIRE or class names/times, whichever is more convenient. A Google calendar will then be created for them to keep track of all their classes. We will also use this calendar to schedule study group meetings.

## Study Group Finder

  Match compatible users to an already existing study group which meets at a certain time and location every week. Users in a study group should share at least one common class, but ideally would share more than one. Users in a study group must all be free at the time which the study group meets. Ideally, the meeting would take place between a user's classes (so that they will likely be on campus), and near to where their next class is.

## Study Group Creator

  Suggest a new study group to users which meets at a certain time and location every week, with the same requirements listed above. If at least 2 users accept the suggestion, create the study group and schedule it.

## User Profiles

  Users will have their own profile pages displaying contact info, classes they are taking/have taken, study groups they are in, and other information about them. Users will be able to share invite links for their study groups and profiles to external websites and applications.
